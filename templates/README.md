# Flask CI/CD Application

This is a simple Flask application integrated with a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**: Installs required Python packages.
2. **Run Tests**: Executes the test suite (currently just a placeholder).
3. **Build**: Prepares the application for deployment.
4. **Deploy to Staging**: Deploys to the staging environment when pushing to the `staging` branch.
5. **Deploy to Production**: Deploys to the production environment when a new release is tagged.

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-flask-app.git
   cd your-flask-app
